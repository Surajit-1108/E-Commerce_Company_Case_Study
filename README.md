Insights:
* The cities to be focused on as part of the marketing strategies are Delhi, Chennai, and Jaipur.
* The downward growth trend in the customer base implies that the marketing campaign by the company is not very effective.
* As the number of orders increases, the customer count decreases.
* The customer category in which the company experienced the most activity is the "Occasional shoppers".
* Product 1 exhibits the highest total revenue with an average purchase quantity of two.
* The electronics products need more focus as they are in high demand among the customers.
* During February 2024, sales experienced the largest decline.
* According to the sales trend analysis, sales from March 2023 to August 2023 fluctuated with no clear trend.
* The month of December 2023 has the highest change in the average order value.
* Product ID 7 has the highest turnover rate and needs to be restocked frequently.
* Poor visibility on the platform might cause certain products to have a purchase rate below 40% of the total customer base. Implementing targeted marketing campaigns to raise 
  awareness and interest may help improve the sales of these underperforming products.
* The analysis suggests that the months of September and December will require major restocking of products and increased staff.
